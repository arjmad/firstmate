# Scout outcome and promotion

A completed scout must leave a self-contained report before its scratch worktree can be discarded; read and relay its findings, record the report as the Done artifact, and re-evaluate the queue.
A report may recommend implementation but does not authorize it.
Before treating the investigation or any visual review as complete, load `captain-hold-lifecycle`; teardown enforces that shared completion gate.
When a scout's deliverable is a visual artifact the captain will iterate on, keep it alive while it is still iterating and follow the crew-hosted Lavish board contract in `docs/configuration.md` rather than arming or polling the board from firstmate.
Once its iteration is finished and its captain calls are held, tear it down: teardown hands its board to firstmate rather than keeping the scout parked for the board (`docs/configuration.md` "Hand a finished scout's board to firstmate").
When implementation is separately authorized, promote the existing scout through `bin/fm-promote.sh` rather than creating a duplicate task.
The promoted worker must inventory scratch state, return to a clean copy of the task's base (its recorded base branch, else the default branch), carry over only intended fix changes, create the ship branch, and follow the project's selected delivery path while leaving scratch commits and debug edits behind and turning a reproduced bug into the regression test.
