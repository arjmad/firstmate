#
# classify   Print the lifecycle state a handler should act on: feedback, ended,
#            waiting, disconnected, interrupted, missing, or unknown.
# read       Print a structured presentation of one already-captured result so a
#            handler consumes every queued item without grepping the raw file.
#            It is read-only over the capture: it does not arm, poll, or change
#            what Lavish delivered. The freeform message (tag=message) is its
#            own labeled field, printed first and distinct from per-element
#            annotations; it is labeled SESSION-ENDING MESSAGE, and counted as
#            session_ending_message_count, only when the session ended, and is
#            otherwise CAPTAIN MESSAGE and captain_message_count. Declared and
#            presented item counts,
#            plus a completeness verdict, follow before all annotations so a
#            partial read is obvious. Each annotation retains its element uid,
#            selector, tag, and text. A non-choice freeform comment (`prompt`)
#            is printed as its own field even when a selector is also present
#            and even when that comment matches the element text, so typed
#            words are never dropped. Choice Context data is not a comment;
#            a choice carrying fm-bearings-answer.v1 context instead prints a
#            BOARD ANSWER block (question, pick, effect, values, note) and the
#            route it takes, so a handler acts on structured fields.
#            Captain-supplied body lines are visibly prefixed so they cannot
#            forge structural labels. Empty message and annotation sections
#            are reported explicitly.
#            Both table-form and list-form captures are supported; nested
#            targets and attachments are skipped while the item's own scalar
#            fields are retained. The shared parser below owns the wire format.
#            Malformed content or a declared/presented count mismatch yields
#            complete: no; inspect that verdict, not just the command's exit
#            status. A declared nonempty block parsed as empty is incomplete.
# poll       The registered listener command `arm` publishes, not a command to
#            run in a conversational turn. It runs the published blocking poll
#            and prints its response verbatim, absorbing only the one exact
#            transient interruption described below. A staged reply still
#            present when it starts is posted before the long-poll: through
#            `lavish-axi reply` when supported, otherwise through the legacy
#            best-effort `poll --agent-reply` path.
# deliver-reply
#            Run by `fm-procevent.sh register-task` under the source lock, only
#            after the task is eligible to own the board, with the listener argv
#            it is about to publish. Exit 0 once Lavish accepts the staged reply,
#            3 when the installed Lavish is a confirmed older release without
#            synchronous reply so the listener keeps the legacy path, and any
#            other status when the reply failed or the version is unknown.
# terminal   Exit 0 when the captured result means this Lavish source will never
#            produce another result, so the runner may retire it; any other exit
#            keeps it armed. This is the generic adapter contract bin/fm-procevent.sh
#            calls, and the only place Lavish's notion of "ended" is decided.
# silent     Exit 0 when the captured result is a routine no-op the runner should
#            record and never announce; any other exit publishes the wake. This
#            is the generic no-op contract bin/fm-procevent.sh calls, and the
#            only place Lavish's notion of "nothing was said" is decided.
#            Task-owned terminal rounds bypass generic silence so their owner
#            receives the stop-and-conclude instruction.
# relisten   Exit 0 only when the runner should keep this source's claim and poll
#            again, which is the generic seam bin/fm-procevent.sh calls after a
#            result. Lavish answers yes for exactly one shape: the captured result
#            the runner names in FM_PROCEVENT_RELISTEN_RESULT is a silent
#            interruption (see below). Every other result, and a call naming no
#            result, keeps the default of one poll per runner.
#
# AN EMPTY BOARD CLOSE IS NOT NEWS, and that is what `silent` exists to say.
# Closing a review surface that carried nothing is the single most common Lavish
# result: the captain reads a board, says nothing, and closes it. Announcing that
# put a wake in front of the handler whose entire content was that nothing
# happened. `silent` therefore holds three narrow, positively-determined shapes -
# a session this adapter classifies `ended` that carries no queued content block
# at all, `browser_disconnected`, which carries no answer while the session
# remains open, and an isolated `interrupted` capture, described below - and
# every other result stays announced.
#
# Deliberately narrow, in both directions. A `Send & End` close carrying the
# captain's actual answer arrives as `status: feedback` with `session_ended`, so
# it classifies `feedback`, never `ended`, and is announced exactly as before; so
# is any `ended` result that still carries a `prompts` or `feedback` block, which
# the published poll is not expected to produce but which must never be dropped
# on that expectation. A `waiting` session, a `missing` one, an `unknown` or
# unreadable result, and any other error all stay announced, because none of them
# positively proves nothing was said. Silence is only ever an absence this
# adapter can see in the result, never an absence it assumes.
#
# This adapter is deliberately thin. It owns only what is specific to Lavish:
# canonical source identity, the argv for the currently published poll command,
# and how to read a completed result. Ownership, durable capture, publication,
# and restart recovery all belong to bin/fm-procevent.sh.
#
# The published poll vocabulary includes feedback, ended, waiting, and
# browser_disconnected. A waiting result from this no-timeout poll means a
# second poller was present; it is not a normal idle round. browser_disconnected
# means the session remains open and is handled as a silent reconnect wait.
# Before each poll attempt, resolve the artifact's saved URL from Lavish's own
# session store (LAVISH_AXI_STATE_DIR/state.json, default ~/.lavish-axi/state.json)
# and use its host and port. Opening the board writes that URL; polling does not.
# This is a routing lookup before the blocking call, not presence polling or a
# second route record. Ambient/configured addresses must not retarget a reply.
# An unreadable or missing session stops before the staged reply is consumed.
#
# `answers` is this adapter's half of the generic keyed-answer contract in
# bin/fm-procevent.sh. It reports what the captain actually chose, as
# `<task-id>\t<answer>\t<label>` lines, and stops there. It maps nothing to a
# task, records no decision, and closes nothing: a captain answer is not special
# to Lavish, so every rule about what a keyed answer DOES belongs to the one
# intake in bin/fm-captain-hold.sh, which the runner feeds. A Lavish review is
# just an ephemeral discussion format that happens to carry answers.
#
# Only rows tagged `choice` are read. A freeform captain message is prose that may
# contain anything, and must never be able to forge a decision key.
#
# A bearings board answer (fm-bearings-answer.v1) feeds the intake only when
# it closes or defers a captain hold, and never on the captain's words alone:
#   - a decision card's picked option (`selection`) feeds as before;
#   - an inbox item's action (`action`) feeds only for effect `close` (its
#     card-declared mode, done by default), `hold-until` (mode
#     `until=<YYYY-MM-DD>` from its `until`), or `remind-at` (the same mode,
#     the date of its `at`), and never for a `blocking` item, which is a
#     worker rather than a hold;
#   - an empty selection or action with a note is a note-only answer: the
#     captain's own instruction for firstmate to read, never a closure.
# Every other effect is firstmate's to route (bearings skill), from `read`.
# `answers` and `reconciles` use the same parser as `read` for either emission
# form. Malformed content or a declared/parsed count mismatch prints a diagnostic
# to stderr and exits 3, even if valid choices were already printed to stdout;
# callers must not treat that output as a complete extraction.
#
# `read` is the presentation command summarized above; keyed intake remains
# the separate `answers` contract described here.
#
# It wraps the published `lavish-axi poll` and `lavish-axi reply` interfaces,
# verified against 0.1.80. `poll` long-polls indefinitely; `reply` exits only
# after the server confirms acceptance. Older compatible versions retain the
# legacy poll-with-reply path, without the synchronous handoff guarantee.
#
# BOUNDED QUIET RETRY, owned here and nowhere else. A live listener can be cut
# short by the server - most often because the Lavish server restarted, as an
# in-place lavish-axi upgrade does - with exactly this response while the
# session's marks remain available:
#
#   error: Lavish Editor poll response was interrupted
#   code: SERVER_ERROR
#
# optionally followed by the one `help[N]: ...` suggestion line that newer
# lavish-axi releases (verified on 0.1.83) append to every error. Nothing else
# may follow, so the whole payload carries no item and no message;
# `interrupted_payload` is the one definition of that shape. That is an internal retry, not news, so
# registering the raw poll made the generic runner capture it and wake the
# whole fleet. `poll` therefore re-runs the published poll up to
# POLL_RETRY_LIMIT times for that response, with attempt starts at least
# POLL_RETRY_DELAY_DEFAULT seconds apart. The match is deliberately narrow:
# real feedback, ended and missing sessions, any other SERVER_ERROR, whitespace
# variants, and the interruption followed by anything but that one help line
# are all printed straight through and captured normally.
#
# Once the bound is spent the interruption is printed and captured, and
# `classify` names it `interrupted`. It is still not news the first time:
# `silent` records it handled and `relisten` keeps the runner polling, so the
# source re-arms on the restarted server instead of waking its owner or
# waiting for reconcile. That re-arm happens once per outage. An interruption
# whose immediately preceding capture of the same source was also an
# interruption, captured at most POLL_INTERRUPTED_REPEAT_SECONDS earlier, means
# the server kept cutting polls across the whole retry bound twice running; it
# is announced like any other error and not relistened, so a server that stays
# broken wakes its owner instead of looping in silence. The retry and the
# re-arm verdict are Lavish facts, so the generic runner in bin/fm-procevent.sh
# stays adapter-agnostic and learns nothing about them.
#
# LOSS LIMITATION, stated plainly. The published poll destructively clears
# feedback before returning it. A result lost after that clearing and before the
# runner reads the process output is unrecoverable, and no Firstmate wrapper can
# close that source-side handoff window. Never describe this path as
# at-least-once, no-loss, or lossless. The only durability this proves is the
# runner's own: output that reached the runner is stored before it is announced.
