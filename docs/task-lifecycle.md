# Task lifecycle

Read the relevant subsection before intake, dispatch, validation, landing, teardown, or scout promotion.
Numbered section references below name `AGENTS.md`; operational paths are relative to the repository or active home as their owners specify.
Referenced scripts own exact commands, flags, and data mechanics.

### Intake and authority

Resolve the project independently for every request.
An explicit project wins, a clear follow-up inherits its referent, and otherwise match the request against the registry, work under way, and project code or README.
Proceed on one confident match while naming the project in plain language; ask one concise question when multiple or no projects plausibly match.

Route by the nature of the work against each registered secondmate scope, not by a non-exclusive clone list.
Keep `local-only` work in the main home.
Send in-scope work to the fitting secondmate unless it is blocked or the captain explicitly redirects it; do not read the secondmate's chat because marked routed replies return through its status or referenced document.
If no secondmate scope fits, use the main home or discuss creating an appropriate persistent secondmate.
For one-off or infrequent operational work, start with the simplest direct end-to-end path.
Do not build wrappers, control planes, policy layers, custom verifiers, or automation unless the direct path exposes a concrete blocker or repeated need that justifies the added machinery.

Before commissioning an investigation, consult existing reports and established evidence.
Classify the deliverable:

- **Ship** is the default and produces a project change through the selected delivery mode; once implementation is authorized, dispatch a ship and keep any remaining bounded research inside it unless unresolved uncertainty could materially change whether or what to build.
- **Scout** produces knowledge in `data/<id>/report.md`, never a PR, and is appropriate for investigation, diagnosis, planning, reproduction, or audit work when the captain explicitly requests a separate knowledge or design deliverable or unresolved uncertainty could materially change whether or what to build.

If established evidence already answers an informational question, relay it without a design-only scout; when implementation intent is unclear, answer and ask one concise implementation question when useful rather than dispatching speculative design work.
Never both present a likely-enough solution and launch a parallel design exercise that is not expected to change it.
A diagnostic request, report, recommendation, or implementation-ready finding is evidence, not authorization to change code.
Load `diagnostic-reasoning` before scoping a reported bug and before acting on a diagnostic report.

Resolve every ship task's concrete delivery mode and `yolo` merge posture at intake.
Pass the mode explicitly to the brief, and pass both values explicitly to the spawn and any scout promotion; each command refuses to guess the values it consumes.
A current explicit captain instruction wins; otherwise the project's registry entry is the captain's standing posture, and dropping below its rigor needs a reason you can state.
On a `no-mistakes-prod-only` project, classify the task's surface: internal-only tooling, automation, contributor or operator process, and release or submission work ships `direct-PR`, while product-facing, mixed, and uncertain work ships `no-mistakes`; never infer internal-only from file location or project name.
An unregistered project or absent registry resolves to `no-mistakes` with yolo off, and the registration gap goes to the captain.
Record the resulting mode, `yolo` merge posture, and the one-line reason for any deviation in the backlog item note.

Treat file or subsystem overlap as a risk signal rather than an automatic reason to wait, and dispatch isolated work immediately with no concurrency cap when each change can be independently implemented and validated and the selected delivery path can reconcile ordinary rebases or conflicts.
Serialize only for a true semantic dependency, shared mutable external state, incompatible concurrent migration, or another concrete condition that makes independent progress or reconciliation unsafe; same-file editing alone is insufficient, and genuine blockers remain durable.
Write the task-specific brief under section 11 before spawning.
Fill the task subsections according to section 11.

### Dispatch and supervision handoff

Spawn only through `bin/fm-spawn.sh` after the profile and backend checks in section 4.
The spawn must resolve a genuine isolated task worktree distinct from the primary checkout; a failed isolation assertion stops the task.
When the configured tasks-axi backlog gate applies, the spawn itself moves the work item to In flight and refuses rather than dispatching work this home has no item for, so recording the dispatch is never a separate step to remember; a manual-backend home retains the hand-editing contract in `docs/configuration.md`.
After spawning, confirm the worker is processing the brief and handle any trust dialog through `harness-adapters`.
A persistent secondmate is recorded in the secondmate registry and runtime state, never as a backlog work item.

Steer a worker with ordinary text through fail-closed `fm-send`: the message becomes a durable record in the task's steering inbox (multi-line text is legal, local and remote alike) and the worker's terminal receives only a constant doorbell line, with the watcher re-ringing an unacknowledged local message and escalating a stuck one (`bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh`; `bin/fm-send.sh` owns the typed-plane carve-outs).
A remote secondmate steer rides the same durable-inbox model through the remote transport; after an unconfirmed delivery, only the exact `FM_PENDING_REPLY_EXISTING_CORR=<id>` resend command printed by `fm-send` is safe because it preserves the request body for remote enqueue deduplication (`bin/fm-send.sh` header).
When a steer answers an open keyed decision or blocker, pass `fm-send`'s `--resolve-key` so the answer itself closes that decision record at answer time, identically for local and remote workers (contract: `bin/fm-send.sh` header).
`fm-send` is the data plane for text the worker should read; never use its key or text paths for interrupt, exit, or other lifecycle control, because routing-marked lifecycle text becomes chat the worker reasons about instead of executing.
Drive a worker's lifecycle through `bin/fm-control.sh <task-id> interrupt|exit|relaunch`, which owns the per-runtime mechanics, verifies each action, and never tears down or discards anything ([`docs/agent-control.md`](agent-control.md)).
A secondmate's routed reply returns through status or a document pointer, not by firstmate peeking into its chat.
For the parent-owned correlation, recovery, and escalation contract on marked secondmate requests, see `bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh`.
Supervise all live work under section 8.

### Selected delivery path and merge authority

The selected delivery path owns its own rigor.
When no-mistakes is selected, no-mistakes alone owns review, fixes, tests, documentation, push, PR, and CI; otherwise follow the faster path without adding an independent reviewer.
Never hold work outside no-mistakes for a manual clean verdict, stack serial manual reviews, or infer authority for one from security, architecture, or risk alone.
A separate review or audit is allowed only when the captain explicitly requests that deliverable or the authorized task is a knowledge-only review; one named question remains scoped to that question.
If fast-path risk needs more rigor, escalate whether to use no-mistakes instead of inventing a manual gate.
The path's worker, automated gates, and captain approval remain authoritative:

- **no-mistakes** runs the full pipeline through a PR, then waits for the configured merge authority.
- **direct-PR** has the worker push and open a PR without the no-mistakes pipeline, then waits for the configured merge authority.
- **local-only** has the worker stop with a clean ready branch, then waits for the configured merge authority before firstmate uses the guarded fast-forward merge path.

Delivery mode and `yolo` are orthogonal.
`yolo` governs merge authority only: with it off, the captain approves every PR merge and every local-only landing; with it on, firstmate merges green, in-scope work itself.
Never merge a red PR under either setting unless a current explicit captain instruction names the single GitHub check waived through `fm-pr-merge.sh --allow-red`; that attended-only waiver still requires every other check green.
Destructive, irreversible, and security-sensitive merges still escalate.
Without a current explicit captain instruction that states the concrete merge, the green default stands, and standing `yolo` cannot authorize a red merge; section 1 owns when such an instruction overrides a Firstmate-written standing rule within its exact scope.
Load `ask-user-authority` before deciding any ask-user finding; the implementation worker never answers its own finding.
Use `bin/fm-pr-merge.sh` for every task PR merge so merge metadata is recorded and an unproved merge is refused instead of reported as landed, and use `bin/fm-merge-local.sh` for approved local-only landing; never call a lower-level merge command around their guards.
After an autonomous merge, give the captain a one-line full-URL or local-main outcome.

### Validate

For a no-mistakes ship, trigger validation on the same worker after its implementation commit, using the harness invocation owned by `harness-adapters`.
The task worker that starts a no-mistakes run drives the pipeline and owns every `no-mistakes axi run` and `no-mistakes axi respond` call through the next gate or outcome.
Firstmate never invokes `no-mistakes axi respond` for a crew-owned run.
When the captain adds or changes an ask mid-task, append the captain's words without added speaker labels or direct address to that brief's `## Captain's intent` and relay those words to the worker; Firstmate build constraints stay in `## Firstmate spec` or the steer.
`bin/fm-dod-lib.sh` owns the worker-side `--intent` contract.
Once validation starts, prefer routing new requirements to follow-up work rather than expanding the current task, unless a new requirement completely invalidates the work being validated; however, the smallest downstream changes needed to keep already accepted product or engineering behavior correct, add behavioral tests where an executable contract exists, or keep documentation accurate remain within the current task even when they touch files not named at intake, and corrections required to satisfy already accepted intent are not new requirements.

Only a current, explicit captain instruction that completely invalidates the work being validated keeps the task with the same worker instead of routing it to follow-up work or handing it to a replacement.
That worker cancels the active run through no-mistakes axi's supported abort command and confirms through axi status that the run has stopped before changing any code.
The worker then follows `branch_sync.next_action` from structured axi status: use axi sync's supported guarded recovery only when its code is `recover_custody`, and otherwise proceed only when structured status confirms that branch ownership is already returned and no recovery is required.
Custody recovery settles branch ownership, not content: the worker must replace the obsolete work from the correct pre-invalidation base rather than building on top of the recovered-but-obsolete head, keeping the obsolete run's own pipeline-fix commits out of what gets validated and shipped.
Apart from that single supported abort, do not hand-edit, commit, restart, or start a second validation run while the obsolete run still owns the branch.
Once ownership is settled, validate exactly once against that final head so no obsolete or intermediate head is ever treated as authoritative.

An ask-user finding returns as `needs-decision`; firstmate loads `ask-user-authority` and either decides or escalates per that skill.
Send the same worker one exact decision naming the decision key, step, action, affected finding IDs, instructions where needed, and exact response command, passing `--resolve-key` so the worker's open decision record closes at answer time.
Require the matching `resolved` event, forbid `--yes`, and require the worker to process every synchronous return until completion or a genuinely new escalation.
Resume fleet supervision immediately after the decision lands.

Judge validation by the resolved state line from [`bin/fm-crew-state.sh`](../bin/fm-crew-state.sh), whose header owns outcome mappings and CI-monitor/daemon exceptions, never by shell liveness, the last status event, or a raw run record.
Workers parked at approval or fix-review must follow the active gate help.
A worker hand-editing, committing, aborting, or restarting during an active validation run duplicates pipeline ownership outside the supersession sequence above; steer it back to the gate response flow.
The worker reports the PR when CI first becomes green rather than waiting for merge monitoring to finish.

### PR ready, landing, and teardown

For PR-based ship tasks, the ready signal depends on mode: `no-mistakes` reports `done [at=<epoch>]: PR <url> checks green` after CI is green, while `direct-PR` reports `done [at=<epoch>]: PR <url>` after opening the PR, each only for a non-draft PR; a lane that deliberately holds a draft declares a wait instead, and `bin/fm-pr-check.sh` refuses to arm merge monitoring on a draft.
Run `bin/fm-pr-check.sh <id> <PR url>` with the URL copied from that ready signal or the resolved checks-green `fm-crew-state.sh` line - it records `pr=` and the forge's `pr_head=` when available in the task's meta and arms the watcher's merge poll.
`bin/fm-dod-lib.sh` owns the named-head gate on that ready signal: a ship `done:` whose named head exists only in the worker's disposable copy is not ready (`bin/fm-crew-state.sh` reports blocked, `bin/fm-pr-check.sh` refuses to register, and a secondmate does not publish that done upstream).
That blocked reading is the gate working, not a stuck worker, so steer the worker on the commit the refusal names rather than waiting.
A direct-PR worker pushes that commit to its PR branch, and a local-only worker commits it on its `fm/<id>` branch.
A no-mistakes worker re-validates it with /no-mistakes so the pipeline stays the one publisher; it never pushes from its copy.
In no-mistakes mode the earlier `done [at=<epoch>]: {summary}` is the pipeline handoff and is not gated.
Tell the captain the PR's full `https://...` URL copied from the worker's ready line, the resolved checks-green crew-state line, or the task's `pr=` metadata, a concise outcome summary, and the no-mistakes risk level when applicable.
A captain instruction to merge is explicit authority; `yolo` is the only standing routine merge authority.
For any custom `state/<id>.check.sh` you write yourself, keep it an ordinary single-link mode-`0700` file, print one line only when firstmate should wake, print nothing otherwise, finish before `FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT`, then bind its current bytes with `bin/fm-check-register.sh <id>` before the watcher may execute it.
Retire a custom check only through `bin/fm-check-unregister.sh <id>` (or `bin/fm-teardown.sh` for a spawned task); never hand-compose an `rm` with `$STATE`/`$ID`.

Tear down a ship task only after landing is confirmed.
A teardown refusal for uncommitted or unlanded work is a stop-and-investigate result, never an obstacle to bypass.
Never force teardown without explicit discard authority.
After successful teardown, record completion, retain only the configured recent Done history, and re-evaluate queued work whose blockers and time gates have cleared.

A secondmate is persistent and an empty queue is healthy.
Retire one only on an explicit captain or main-firstmate decision, after loading `secondmate-provisioning`; its home must contain no work under way, and forced discard still requires explicit captain authority.

### Scout outcome and promotion

A completed scout must leave a self-contained report before its scratch worktree can be discarded; read and relay its findings, record the report as the Done artifact, and re-evaluate the queue.
A report may recommend implementation but does not authorize it.
Before treating the investigation or any visual review as complete, load `captain-hold-lifecycle`; teardown enforces that shared completion gate.
When a scout's deliverable is a visual artifact the captain will iterate on, keep it alive and follow the crew-hosted Lavish board contract in `docs/configuration.md` rather than arming or polling the board from firstmate.
When implementation is separately authorized, promote the existing scout through `bin/fm-promote.sh` rather than creating a duplicate task.
The promoted worker must inventory scratch state, return to a clean default-branch base, carry over only intended fix changes, create the ship branch, and follow the project's selected delivery path while leaving scratch commits and debug edits behind and turning a reproduced bug into the regression test.


## Backlog contract

The configured `tasks-axi` backend is the durable queue; the tracked default is `data/backlog.md`.
It tracks work items only, never agents; persistent secondmates never appear as backlog items.
Work routed to a secondmate is recorded in that secondmate home's own backlog, not the main backlog.
A decision is simply a task held for the captain: create the task with `bin/fm-tasks-axi.sh add` when needed, then always hold it through `bin/fm-captain-hold.sh hold <id> --reason "<reason>"`, with `--until <date>` when the captain defers it.
When a main-side thread such as a pending captain decision or relay reminder is worth durable tracking, file it as its own work item and hold it through that wrapper.
Captain calls discovered by investigations or visual reviews follow `captain-hold-lifecycle`, which owns their completion gate and recorded-answer rules.
When the automatic transition gate applies, dispatch and completion move the item themselves - `bin/fm-spawn.sh` and `bin/fm-teardown.sh` own those transitions and refuse rather than report success without them - so what remains yours is filing the item before dispatch, recording decisions, and keeping notes current; `docs/configuration.md` owns gate applicability and the manual-backend exception.
Re-evaluate queued work after every teardown and heartbeat, dispatching items only when dependencies and time gates have cleared.

`.tasks.toml`, `docs/configuration.md`, and current `tasks-axi --help` own the backlog schema, compatibility, retention, and routine command syntax.
Use compatible `tasks-axi` when the configured backend selects it, always through `bin/fm-tasks-axi.sh` so the call reaches this home's backlog from any directory, and the documented manual path otherwise; keep only the configured recent Done entries.
`secondmate-provisioning` and `bin/fm-backlog-handoff.sh` own cross-home handoff safety.

Keep free-form notes free of temporary paths, moving versions, ephemeral identifiers, and copied state that will rot.
Inspect the current task note before replacing its considered body, and archive the superseded body when recoverability matters rather than appending by default.
Verify volatile details against their authoritative config, live system, or API before acting, and correct or delete stale prose immediately.
Preserve durable structured identifiers, dependencies, and completion artifact links, and route reusable knowledge to section 6 rather than scattering it through task notes.


## Crewmate briefs

`bin/fm-brief.sh` and its help own scaffold syntax, generated variants, status protocol, delivery-mode definitions of done, and exact safety mechanics.
Use its scaffold as the contract, then fill `## Captain's intent` (`{TASK}`) with the captain's own ask and any boundary the captain stated, plus the context needed to read it, including the substance of any report, decision, or PR the ask refers to; never widen the ask there into a general goal or an enumerated coverage list, because the reviewer treats that subsection as acceptance criteria.
Fill `## Firstmate spec` (`{FIRSTMATE_SPEC}`) with only the build instructions that ask requires, naming what stays out of scope when the ask is narrow; a generalization, consistency sweep, or extra hardening the captain did not ask for is follow-up work to note, not scope to add.
`bin/fm-dod-lib.sh` owns intent authoring without added speaker labels or direct address, its provenance markers, what a no-mistakes worker may pass as `--intent`, and the string's self-sufficiency rule.
Keep additions task-specific rather than repeating lifecycle instructions, and alter generated sections only when the task genuinely differs from the standard shape.

Every ship brief must retain the worktree-isolation assertion and stop if launched in the primary checkout.
If a ship task touches firstmate's shared tracked material, explicitly require `firstmate-coding-guidelines` before editing.
If a task will drive Herdr lifecycle behavior, scaffold with `--herdr-lab`; if that need appears after an unguarded scaffold, stop and regenerate rather than adding commands by hand.
The generated Herdr contract must use a named non-`default` isolated lab and its guarded helper for every lifecycle action.

Load `secondmate-provisioning` before creating or using a charter brief and preserve its idle-by-default and marked-return-channel contracts.
Status appends are sparse supervisor-actionable events, not routine progress; `bin/fm-classify-lib.sh` owns keyed open and resolved semantics.
The scaffold is a safety contract, not a suggestion.
