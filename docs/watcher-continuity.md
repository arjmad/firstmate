# Watcher continuity

The watcher remains intentionally one-shot: one actionable reason closes one watcher cycle.
Must-work continuity now lives above that process boundary instead of depending on the model remembering a re-arm step.

## Ownership

Pi's `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` and OpenCode's `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-watch-arm.js` own continuous re-arm after an actionable child close.
Each adapter starts the next arm before delivering the wake prompt, checks current session-lock ownership at launch, preserves one child or scheduled retry at a time, and applies bounded exponential retry after an unexpected or failed close.
A failed follow-up never cancels continuity restoration.
Claude's `.claude/settings.json` Stop `asyncRewake` hook (`bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh`) owns routine tokenless re-arm.
Its required position before the synchronous turn-end guard is owned by [`turnend-guard.md`](turnend-guard.md#harness-integrations).
The hook fires on every Stop, and an eligible primary with supervision need admits one home-scoped owner that foregrounds `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` inside the hook-owned process tree.
Claude lock ownership uses its declared `CLAUDE_PID` only when that PID is a live Claude process in the current ancestry and the nearer detected harness is also Claude-shaped.
That stable identity lets a lock-command lane and a later Stop-hook lane in the same session agree after a mid-session takeover.
A restarted session may instead dispatch its Stop hook through a nearer Claude daemon lane with no `CLAUDE_PID`; that lane owns the home only when the recorded live Claude lock owner is its ancestor.
Requiring both processes to be Claude-shaped preserves the nested non-Claude boundary, while the ancestry requirement excludes competing sessions.
A numeric session-lock owner that fails the shared `fm_harness_pid_alive` predicate is reclaimed through `bin/fm-lock.sh` before auto-arm state changes, while a live owner, absent lock, or malformed lock keeps the competing hook inert.
The stale-owner claim occurs only after the existing AFK and supervision-need gates pass.
While supervision is still needed and away mode remains inactive, an actionable close or typed failure wakes the idle session through exit 2.

## Actionable wake ordering

After an actionable Pi or OpenCode child close, the adapter starts and verifies one singleton successor before it delivers the original wake.
It waits at most one readiness timeout per attempt, then sends TERM and waits a bounded retirement confirmation before the next lock-verified exponential retry.
If the unready arm does not retire within that bound, the adapter keeps ownership, starts no overlapping retry, and delivers the typed fallback immediately.
When that retained arm later closes, its actual close is classified as a new supervised event without replaying the earlier fallback.
After the configured retry bound is exhausted, it delivers the original wake with a typed continuity-restoration failure even if every successor arm hung without reporting readiness.
This is deliberate Option B ordering: the fleet is protected before the model handles the wake whenever restoration succeeds, but the model is never left blind when it does not.

Claude's Stop hook starts the successor arm at the next Stop after the handling turn, rather than before notification as Pi and OpenCode do.
The durable wake queue preserves actionable events during the residual active-turn window, and the unchanged bounded turn-end guard enforces recovery at Stop when no watcher or auto-arm claim is present.
No PreToolUse hook denies fleet commands based on watcher status.
The model no longer re-arms after ordinary wakes.
Terminal arm-output classification (`started`, `attached`, or `FAILED`) remains defense in depth for the manual recovery path.
Codex retains its bounded foreground checkpoint protocol.
Grok retains its tracked background-task notification protocol.
No adapter starts a replacement with shell `&`.

The turn-end guard remains the final backstop rather than the normal continuity mechanism and cooperates with the auto-arm in its `--claude` mode.

## Arm-layer cycle contract

`bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` never returns an unexplained clean empty success.
An actionable child output returns that reason normally.
A zero/empty child return rechecks the home lock and beacon, attaches to a verified healthy successor when one exists, or emits `watcher: FAILED - cycle ended without an actionable reason` and exits nonzero.
An attached follower whose chain ends without a successor first consults the cycle ledger for an `actionable-*` record naming its watcher PID inside the attach window; the owner arm writes that record before printing the wake.
On a recorded delivery the follower appends an `attached-cycle-delivered` row and closes quietly (exit 0, no output) so one wake is never notified twice; otherwise it reports the same typed failure.
A killed or crashed watcher writes no actionable record, so genuine silent death still fails loud, and the owner arm's own empty-close failure is unchanged.

The arm layer appends one tab-separated record per observed cycle to `state/.watch-cycle-exits.log`.
Each record includes arm and watcher PIDs, start and end timestamps, exit code and signal, classified reason, beacon age, lock identity before and after close, and successor disposition.
The file is size-capped through `FM_WATCH_CYCLE_LOG_MAX_BYTES` and `FM_WATCH_CYCLE_LOG_KEEP_LINES`.
`state/.watch-triage.log` remains only the watcher's bounded absorbed-wake debug log and carries no lifecycle semantics.

The default 300-second grace is unchanged.
Only the watcher process touches `state/.last-watcher-beat`; no helper process can make a wedged watcher appear healthy.

## Regression coverage

`tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh` checks Pi's first-cycle-or-explicit-repair tool metadata and ownership-based redundant-call no-ops, then simulates actionable and empty child closes against the actual Pi and OpenCode close handlers, blocks prompt delivery to prove the successor launches first, verifies single-flight behavior, changes the session lock before close to prove ownership is rechecked, and hangs each successor arm to prove bounded fallback delivery includes the typed restoration failure.
`tests/fm-watcher-lock.test.sh` covers verified-successor attach, the typed self-eviction failure, bounded and successor-linked lifecycle rows, and a SIGSTOP counterfactual that distinguishes a live PID from a stale beacon before classifying termination.
`tests/fm-subagent-pretool-check.test.sh` proves Claude retains only the non-status Bash seatbelts.
`tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh` covers the auto-arm's scope, stale and live session owners, mid-session takeover across distinct Claude execution lanes, restarted-session daemon lanes without `CLAUDE_PID`, ordinary-cycle re-claim in registered Stop-hook order, unchanged AFK and need boundaries, single-flight, and exit-2 translation.
`FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh` starts with the reproduced stale-lock state, runs session start first, completes two tokenless cycles, and checks the competing-live-owner negative control.
`tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh` covers the cooperative `--claude` guard.

## Active limits and verification

The goal is continuity without a Pi or OpenCode model-memory re-arm step.
No zero-latency guarantee is claimed because lock verification, watcher startup, and bounded retry delays remain deliberate safety work.
OpenCode support targets persistent TUI sessions rather than headless `opencode run`.
Claude depends on the Stop `asyncRewake` rewake, Grok retains native background-completion notifications, and Codex retains bounded foreground checkpoints.

[`verification/supervision.md`](verification/supervision.md#watcher-continuity) records the current five-harness live evidence, the Stop-owned Claude auto-arm results, and exact opt-in commands.
